                    <p>
                        Sports Predictor uses machine learning and statistical analysis to predict the outcomes of sports games. 
                        Our approach is inspired by data journalism sites like FiveThirtyEight, focusing on clear presentation 
                        of statistical information and prediction confidence.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We believe in transparent predictive modeling, where users can understand not just what might happen, 
                        but why our model believes it will happen and how confident we are in that prediction.

                        The Prediction Model
                    </h3>
                    <p>
                        Our prediction model uses a combination of:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Historical Game Data:</strong> Past performance between teams, including scores, 
                            margins of victory, and game conditions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Team Performance Metrics:</strong> Offensive and defensive ratings, recent form, 
                            and home/away performance differentials.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Machine Learning:</strong> Random Forest regression models that learn patterns from 
                            historical data and improve over time.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Bayesian Probability:</strong> Confidence intervals that express prediction certainty 
                            based on available data.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        As more game results come in, our model automatically learns and improves its predictive capabilities.

                        Understanding Predictions
                    </h3>
                    
                    <div class="card bg-light mb-3">

                            <p>
                                Our model predicts the most likely final score for each team. These are expressed as decimal 
                                values (like 105.3 points) to represent the expected average if the game were played many times 
                                under identical conditions.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                            <h5 class="card-title">Win Probability</h5>
                            <p>
                                Win probabilities represent the likelihood of each outcome. For example, a 65% chance for Team A 
                                means that if this exact game were played 100 times, Team A would win approximately 65 of those games.

                            <p>
                                The confidence score indicates how much reliable data our model has to make this particular prediction. 
                                Higher confidence means more relevant historical data and more consistent patterns.
                            </p>

                                <strong>Low confidence</strong> predictions may still be accurate, but have more uncertainty due to 
                                limited data or highly variable past performance.
